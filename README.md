## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

1. **Band Stop Filter**  
   - This script demonstrates the implementation of a band-stop filter, which removes specific frequency components from a signal while allowing others to pass through.
   - **Features**:
     - Design of a band-stop filter.
     - Visualization of the input and filtered signals.
     - Analysis of filter properties such as cutoff frequencies and attenuation.

2. **Frequency Response of a First-Order System**  
   - This script calculates and visualizes the frequency response of a first-order system.
   - **Features**:
     - Plot of magnitude and phase response.
     - Interactive exploration of system parameters like gain and time constant.
     - Useful for understanding system dynamics and control applications.

3. **Matrix Operations**  
   - This script demonstrates matrix manipulations and operations in MATLAB.
   - **Features**:
     - Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
     - Determinant, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors calculation.
     - Applications in linear algebra and system modeling.
